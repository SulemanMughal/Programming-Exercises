we define the Euclidean distance by the formula:

![equation_2](./pic_2.JPG)

Implement a function called euclidean_distance() that computes the distance between two points.


**Example:**


    [IN]: euclidean_distance([0, 3], [4, 0])
    [OUT]: 5.0


**Note:** You only need to implement this function.
