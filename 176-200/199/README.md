# Exercise No. 199

Dot product of vectors v, w:

![equation_1](./pic_1.JPG)

we define as:

![equation_2](./pic_2.JPG)

Implement a function called dot_product() that takes two lists of the same length (vectors) and calculate the dot product. We assume that user gives a correctly defined vector.


**Example:**


    [IN]: dot_product([1, 2], [5, 2])
    [OUT]: 9


**Note:** You only need to implement this function.
