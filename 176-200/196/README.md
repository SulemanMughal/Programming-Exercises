# Exercise No. 196

Implement a function called transpose() that transposes the two-dimensional matrix (nested list).


**Argument:**

    array - nested list (two-dimensional matrix)


**Example:**


    [IN]: transpose([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    [OUT]: [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]


    [IN]: transpose([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    [OUT]: [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]


    [IN]: transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])
    [OUT]: [[1, 5], [2, 6], [3, 7], [4, 8]]


**Note:** You only need to implement this function.
