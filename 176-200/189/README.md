# Exercise No. 189

Implement a function called transfer_zeros() which takes the list as an argument and return list with all zeros at the end.


**Example:**


    [IN]: transfer_zeros([3, 4, 0, 2, 0, 5, 1, 6, 2])
    [OUT]: [3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 0]


**Note:** You only need to implement this function.
